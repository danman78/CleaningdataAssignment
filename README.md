# CleaningdataAssignment
Code completed for cleaning data project.

The code reads the training and test data from a data set collected 
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data are combined, and then the average and standard deviation 
for each measurement are extracted.  From this is calculated the 
average response for each activity for each subject.  This is 
then presented in a final table called "averagedata"
